# Next Train - Melbourne(In progress)
My first React Native project, thought I'd make a simple train journey planning app for Melbournians.

TODO
- DRY up code and clean up variable naming
- Add PropTypes to all components that require it
- Add vibration to SortableListView onPress
- Add "Add up to 6 saved journeys" message on favourite screen when journeys.length === 0
- Style components
